Java Array vs Java List
------------------------------
An array is mutable, and we saw, that we could set or change values in the array, but we could not resize it.
Java gives us several classes that let us add and remove items, and resize a sequence of elements.
These classes are said to implement a List's behavior.

List is special type in Java, called an Interface.

The ArrayList is a class, that really maintains an array in memory, that's actually bigger than what we need, in most cases.
It keeps track of the capacity, which is the actual size of the array in memory.
But it also keeps track of the elements that have been assigned or set, which is the size of the ArrayList.
As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity may need to grow. This all happens automatically, behind the scenes.

This is why the ArrayList is resizeable.
