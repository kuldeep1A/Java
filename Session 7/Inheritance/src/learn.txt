Overridden Method
The overridden method can do noe of three things:
> It can implement completely different behavior, overriding the behavior of the parent.
> It can simply call the parent class's method, which is somewhat redundant to do.
> Or the method can call the parent class's method, and include other code to
    run, so it can extend the functionality for the Dog, for that behavior.
