this vs super

Let's start with the 'super', and the 'this' keywords first.
The keyword 'super' is used to access or call the parent class members(variables and methods).

The keyword 'this' is used to call the current class members(variables and methods).

'this' is required, when we have a parameter with the same name, as na instance variable or field.
NOTE: We can use either of them anywhere in a class, except for static elements, like a static method. Any attempt to do
so there, will lead to compile time errors.
